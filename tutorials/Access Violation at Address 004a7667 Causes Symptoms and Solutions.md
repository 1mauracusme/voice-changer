## Method 1: Run a Malware Scan
 
One of the possible reasons for the access violation at address error is malware infection. Malware can interfere with the normal operation of your programs and cause them to access invalid memory locations. If you've noticed your computer acting up before getting this error, such as unprovoked alerts or fake browser windows, then a detailed and deep scan should be done. If you're just using the built-in antivirus software and it doesn't find anything, you may want to try another option to see if a malware infection is hiding on your system.
 
There are many free and reliable malware removal tools that you can download and use, such as Malwarebytes, AdwCleaner, or HitmanPro. These tools can detect and remove various types of malware, such as viruses, spyware, adware, ransomware, rootkits, and more. To use them, simply download and install the tool of your choice, launch it, and follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure to update the tool before scanning and delete any suspicious files or programs that it finds.
 
## Method 2: Update Your Drivers
 
Another common cause of the access violation at address error is outdated or faulty drivers. Drivers are software components that allow your hardware devices to communicate with your operating system and applications. If your drivers are not up to date or compatible with your system, they can cause conflicts and errors with your programs. For example, if your graphics card driver is outdated or corrupted, it can cause your games or video editing software to crash with an access violation at address error.
 
To fix this issue, you need to update your drivers to the latest version available from the manufacturer's website. You can do this manually by visiting the website of each device manufacturer and downloading and installing the appropriate driver for your model and operating system. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool that can automatically scan your system and update all your drivers with one click. Some examples of driver updater tools are Driver Booster, Driver Easy, or Driver Talent.
 
## Method 3: Reinstall the Program
 
Sometimes, the access violation at address error can be caused by corrupted or missing files in the program that triggered it. This can happen due to improper installation, accidental deletion, disk errors, or malware infection. To fix this problem, you need to reinstall the program and make sure that all its files are intact and in the right place.
 
To reinstall a program on Windows 10, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Windows + I keys to open Settings.
2. Click on Apps.
3. Find and select the program that caused the error from the list of installed apps.
